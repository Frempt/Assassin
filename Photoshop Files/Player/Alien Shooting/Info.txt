James,

These are 8 frames for the Alien shooting the mind Seed. The last two (7,8) is the seed shot, while 1-6 is the gun folding out. The frames can also be reversed so the gun is folding back in. Also, Frames 7 and 8 should be reversed anyway, as the liens has recoil which he recovers from.

Make Sense?
